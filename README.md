# Prism
What is Prism? A framework that leverages the Microsoft bot framework to accelerate chatbot development. Prism dynamically generates dialogue flows, schedule tasks and CLI styled commands based on content originated by the Prism IDE. Prism uses an open source node-NLP library to make intent recognition simpler and provides the feature to use external NLPs with very little coding.

Prism is currently used to build chatbots internally with testing still in progress. Unit test suites are still being developed. Please use it as you see fit. We'd love to have you participate in developing unit test cases for Prism!

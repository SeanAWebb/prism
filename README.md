# Prism
What is Prism? A framework that leverages the Microsoft bot framework to accelerate chatbot development. Prism dynamically generates dialogue flows, schedule tasks and CLI styled commands based on content originated by the Prism IDE. Prism uses an open source node-NLP library to make intent recognition simpler and provides the feature to use external NLPs with very little coding.

Prism is currently used to build chatbot prototypes internally with testing still in progress. Until testing is complete, Prism isn't recommended for Production usage.
